# Project: AlpialCanada Online Product Catalog

## âœ… Project Status: 100% Complete & Production-Ready

The final action items have been completed:

1.  **Database Upgraded:** The `my-catalog-db` service on Render has been upgraded to a paid "Basic" tier, ensuring data persistence and preventing deletion.
2.  **Web Service Upgraded:** The `my-strapi-backend` service on Render has been upgraded to the "Standard" tier. This has successfully resolved the memory and timeout issues, allowing for reliable image uploads in the Strapi admin panel.

All functional and non-functional requirements have been met, and all operational bottlenecks have been eliminated.

### No Further Steps Required

The project is now officially **100% complete**.
