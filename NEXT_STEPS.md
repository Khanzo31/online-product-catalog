# Project Completion Plan

This document outlines the final remaining tasks required to complete the Online Product Catalog website according to the project specification. The project's core functionality is complete, and all P3 (Nice-to-Have) features have been implemented.

The remaining tasks are divided into two distinct categories: **Email Integration** and **SEO Enhancement**.

---

## 1. Final Core Functionality: Email Integration (High Priority)

This is the final critical step to make the website fully operational. It involves integrating a transactional email service so that product inquiries are sent to the administrator and confirmed with the customer.

### Prerequisites:

- **Domain Name:** A registered domain name (e.g., from Google Domains, Namecheap).
- **Resend Account:** A free account at [resend.com](https://resend.com).
- **Verified Domain in Resend:** The domain must be added to Resend and verified via DNS records.
- **Resend API Key:** An API key created in the Resend dashboard.

### Remaining Requirements:

| ID           | Requirement Name              | Priority | Status      |
| :----------- | :---------------------------- | :------- | :---------- |
| **NFR-5.1**  | Transactional Email Service   | P1       | **Pending** |
| **FR-2.3.1** | Customer Inquiry Confirmation | P2       | **Pending** |

### Implementation Steps (Backend - Strapi):

1.  **Install Resend SDK:** In the `backend/my-strapi-project` directory, run `npm install resend`.
2.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Add the following to the `backend/my-strapi-project/.env` file:
    - `RESEND_API_KEY=<Your Resend API Key>`
    - `ADMIN_EMAIL=<The administrator's email address>`
    - `FROM_EMAIL=<Your verified 'from' address on Resend>`
3.  **Create a Lifecycle Hook:** Create a new file at `backend/my-strapi-project/src/api/inquiry/content-types/inquiry/lifecycles.ts`.
4.  **Add Email Logic:** Implement the `afterCreate` function in the lifecycle hook to use the Resend SDK. This function will:
    - Send a detailed inquiry notification to the `ADMIN_EMAIL`.
    - Send a simple confirmation message to the customer's email address.
5.  **Restart and Test:** Restart the Strapi server and submit a test inquiry from the live frontend to confirm both emails are sent and received correctly.

## 2. Technical Enhancement: SEO (P1)

These tasks are essential for optimizing the website's visibility in search engines like Google. They ensure that search engines can effectively crawl, index, and understand the content of each product page.

### Remaining Requirements:

| ID          | Requirement Name         | Priority | Status      |
| :---------- | :----------------------- | :------- | :---------- |
| **NFR-3.2** | Meta Tags                | P1       | **Pending** |
| **NFR-3.3** | Structured Data (Schema) | P1       | **Pending** |
| **NFR-3.4** | Sitemap.xml              | P1       | **Pending** |

### Implementation Steps (Frontend - Next.js):

1.  **Refactor Product Detail Page (`products/[documentId]/page.tsx`):**

    - The page must be converted from a pure Client Component (`"use client"`) to a structure that supports server-side metadata generation. The recommended approach is to split it into a Server Component (parent) for data fetching and metadata, and a Client Component (child) for the interactive elements (image gallery, favorite button).
    - Implement the `generateMetadata` function in the new parent Server Component to dynamically create unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags for each product.

2.  **Add Structured Data:**

    - Within the refactored Product Detail Page, add a `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag.
    - This script will contain `Product` schema markup from [Schema.org](https://schema.org/Product), dynamically populating fields like `name`, `description`, `image`, `sku`, and `offers`.

3.  **Generate Sitemap:**
    - Create a new file at `frontend/src/app/sitemap.ts`.
    - This file will export a default function that programmatically fetches all product and static page URLs from the Strapi API.
    - It will then return an array of these URLs, formatted according to the sitemap protocol. Next.js will use this file to automatically generate a `sitemap.xml` file at build time.
