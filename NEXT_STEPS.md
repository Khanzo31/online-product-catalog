## Next Steps

With the application now live, the final tasks involve integrating third-party services to complete the user journey and enhance search visibility.

### 1. Final Core Functionality: Email Integration (High Priority)

This is the last critical step to make the inquiry system fully operational. It involves integrating a transactional email service so that product inquiries are sent to the administrator and confirmed with the customer.

- **(NFR-5.1)** Integrate a transactional email service (e.g., **Resend**).
- **(FR-2.3.1)** Send an automated confirmation email to the customer after an inquiry.

### 2. Technical Enhancement: SEO (P1)

These tasks are essential for optimizing the website's visibility in search engines.

- **(NFR-3.2)** Dynamically generate unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags for each product page.
- **(NFR-3.3)** Add structured data (`Product` schema from Schema.org) to product pages.
- **(NFR-3.4)** Automatically generate a `sitemap.xml` file.
