# Project: AlpialCanada Online Product Catalog

## âœ… Project Status: Live with Known Limitation

The website is live and all features are functionally complete and verified on the production domain (`https://www.alpialcanada.com`).

However, the Strapi backend, hosted on the **Render Free Tier**, has a critical performance limitation that prevents the reliable upload of multiple or large images, as documented in `DEVELOPER_NOTES_3.md`.

The current workaround (pre-compressing images and uploading them one-by-one) is not suitable for a production environment.

## ðŸš€ Final Step: Upgrade Backend Hosting Plan

The final action required to complete this project is to upgrade the backend server to a paid tier to eliminate the image upload bottleneck.

### Action Plan

1.  **Log in** to your account on [Render.com](https://dashboard.render.com/).
2.  Navigate to the dashboard and select the **`my-strapi-backend`** web service.
3.  In the service's menu, go to the **"Settings"** tab.
4.  Under the "Instance Type" section, click **"Change"**.
5.  Select the **"Starter"** plan (or a higher tier if desired). You will be prompted to add billing information.
6.  **Confirm** the change. Render will automatically apply the new resources and redeploy the service. This may take a few minutes.

### Verification

Once the Strapi backend has been upgraded and redeployed, the success of the upgrade must be verified:

1.  Log in to the production Strapi admin panel: `https://my-strapi-backend-l5qf.onrender.com/admin`.
2.  Navigate to the **Media Library**.
3.  Attempt to upload **multiple (3-5) high-resolution, uncompressed images** at the same time.
4.  **Expected Result:** All images upload successfully and appear in the Media Library without any UI errors, browser console errors, or server crashes. The admin panel should remain responsive throughout the process.

## ðŸŽ‰ Project Complete

Once the verification test passes, the project is officially **100% complete**, having met all functional and non-functional requirements without the need for operational workarounds.
