## Next Steps: Final Enhancements

With all core functionality complete, the final phase involves technical enhancements to maximize the site's visibility and performance.

### 1. SEO Implementation (P1)

These tasks are essential for optimizing the website's visibility in search engines.

- **(NFR-3.2)** Dynamically generate unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags for each product page using Next.js `generateMetadata`.
- **(NFR-3.3)** Add structured data (`Product` schema from Schema.org) to product pages for rich snippets.
- **(NFR-3.4)** Automatically generate a `sitemap.xml` file to help search engines discover all pages.
