# Developer Notes & Project History (Part 4 - Feature Completion & Final Debugging)

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the project's final debugging phase and the implementation of all "nice-to-have" features. It serves as the definitive continuity plan and technical guide for the project in its current state.

## üöÄ Project Status: Functionally Complete

All P1, P2, and P3 "nice-to-have" features discussed have been successfully implemented. The application is stable and fully functional in both local development and production environments. The only remaining tasks are the integration of external services (Email & SEO) as outlined in the original requirements.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Project "Gotchas" & Key Learnings

This project has a unique technical configuration. Any future development **MUST** adhere to the following established patterns:

1.  **Strapi API Returns a "Flat" Structure:** Unlike modern Strapi defaults, the API for lists (e.g., `/api/products`) returns a flat array of objects (`response.data`). It does not use the nested `attributes` structure. All frontend data mapping must expect this v4-style response.

2.  **Routing is by `documentId` (string):** The standard numeric `/:id` route is not used. All links and fetches for single items must use a filter on the `documentId` string (e.g., `/products?filters[documentId][$eq]=...`). The `documentId` is the canonical identifier for all frontend routing.

3.  **Use `populate=*` for API Calls:** The `populate` query parameter is sensitive. The most robust and reliable method for fetching relations is to use `populate=*`, which works for all content types. Avoid complex, multi-level, or comma-separated populate queries as they have been shown to fail.

4.  **API Field Names are Case-Sensitive:** The API IDs for relations are case-sensitive (e.g., the relation from `Product` to `Product Type` is `Product` with an uppercase 'P'). Always verify the exact, case-sensitive API ID in the Strapi Content-Type Builder before writing fetch logic.

5.  **Dashboard Authentication is a "Dual-Check":** The dashboard has a two-part security model:

    - **Layout (`layout.tsx`):** Handles the UI, showing the `LoginForm` if the password cookie is invalid.
    - **Page (`page.tsx`):** Contains its own identical cookie check to prevent its server-side data fetching from _ever running_ if unauthenticated. Both are required to prevent server crashes.

6.  **Local Development Environment Configuration:**
    - **Image Uploads:** To upload images locally, the Cloudinary provider **must be commented out** in `backend/my-strapi-project/config/plugins.ts`.
    - **Image Display:** For local images to display, the local Strapi hostname (`127.0.0.1:1337`) **must be added** to the `remotePatterns` in `frontend/next.config.ts`.
    - **Dashboard Data:** For the dashboard to fetch data, a read-only `STRAPI_API_TOKEN` **must be generated** in the local Strapi admin panel and added to the `frontend/.env.local` file.

## üêû The Great Debugging Saga: A Post-Mortem

The project underwent several extensive debugging phases to reach its current stable state.

### 1. The Great API Debug (Initial Connection)

- **Symptoms:** Invalid data, `400 Bad Request` errors, missing UI elements in Strapi.
- **Resolutions:**
  1.  **Misconfigured Backend Service:** The `/api/product/services/product.ts` file was reset to its default state to fix the `/api/products` endpoint serving the wrong content type.
  2.  **Schema Corruption:** The `images` and `Product` relations were deleted and recreated in the Content-Type Builder to fix a corrupted schema that caused populate queries to fail and permissions UI to disappear.
  3.  **API Structure Anomaly:** The entire frontend was refactored to handle the project's v4-style "flat" API response.
  4.  **Routing:** The entire frontend was refactored to use the `documentId` and filter-based lookups instead of numeric IDs.
  5.  **Form Submissions:** Inquiry form submissions were fixed by enabling `create` permissions and using the correct case-sensitive `Product` field ID.

### 2. The Dashboard Authentication Debug

- **Symptom 1 (Pre-Login Crash):** The server crashed with "Unauthorized" errors when navigating to `/dashboard` while logged out.
- **Resolution 1:** The "Dual-Check" system was implemented. The layout renders the `LoginForm`, and the page component adds its own security check to bail out before fetching data if unauthenticated.
- **Symptom 2 (Post-Login Failure):** The dashboard displayed empty "0" stats after a successful login.
- **Resolution 2:** The root cause was a missing `STRAPI_API_TOKEN` in the `.env.local` file. Generating a token in the local Strapi instance and adding it to the environment file fixed the issue.

### 3. Local Image Handling Debug

- **Symptom 1 (Uploads):** Image uploads failed with a "Failed to fetch" error.
- **Resolution 1:** The `cloudinary` provider was commented out in `config/plugins.ts` for local development.
- **Symptom 2 (Display):** Images failed to display, with `404` errors from the Next.js Image Optimizer.
- **Resolution 2:** The local Strapi hostname (`127.0.0.1`) was added to the `remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts`.
- **Symptom 3 (Favorites):** Old favorited items had broken images.
- **Resolution 3:** This was traced to stale data in the browser's local storage. Clearing the `product_favorites` key resolved the issue permanently.

## ‚ú® Newly Implemented "Nice-to-Have" Features

The following P3-level features have been successfully implemented and are fully functional.

- **Advanced Sorting on Search Page:** A dropdown menu was added to the search results page, allowing users to perform client-side sorting by Price (Asc/Desc) and Name (A-Z/Z-A).
- **Related Products Section:** A "You might also like" section now appears on product detail pages, showing up to four other products from the same `Product Type`.
- **On-Card Favorite Button:** A heart icon has been added to the top-right of product cards on the Home and Search pages, allowing users to favorite items without navigating to the detail page.
- **Custom Property Display:** The product detail page now renders a "Specifications" table, displaying the key-value pairs of any custom properties associated with the product. Boolean values are automatically formatted to "Yes" or "No" for readability.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

The project is now ready for the final P1/P2 feature implementations, which involve integrating third-party services.

1.  **Transactional Email Service (High Priority):**
    - **(NFR-5.1 & FR-2.3.1)** Integrate the **Resend** email service into the backend. This should be implemented via a Strapi `lifecycles.ts` hook on the `Inquiry` content type to automatically send an email to the administrator and a confirmation to the customer upon successful submission.
2.  **SEO Enhancements (High Priority):**
    - **(NFR-3.2, 3.3, 3.4)** Implement dynamic SEO features in the Next.js frontend. This includes using the `generateMetadata` function for unique titles/descriptions, adding a `Product` JSON-LD schema for rich snippets, and creating a dynamic `sitemap.xml` file.
